# Artifact and Overlay Cleanup Summary

## Objective
Performed a repo-wide cleanup to remove stray fractal/artifact visuals and unwanted overlays while preserving key elements as specified.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed clipPath/mask from Lao Shifu Logo Image

**File:** `index.html`

**CSS Changes (lines ~3007-3022):**
- Removed `clip-path: url(#lao-fractal-clip)` property
- Removed `-webkit-clip-path: url(#lao-fractal-clip)` property
- Removed `@supports not (clip-path: url(#lao-fractal-clip))` fallback block
- Updated logo to use `border-radius: 50%` for clean circular rendering

**Result:** The Lao Shifu logo image now renders cleanly inside its decorative circular frame without any cutouts or masking applied directly to the image.

### 2. Removed SVG clipPath Definition

**File:** `index.html`

**Removed Section (lines ~3952-4031):**
- Entire `<svg>` block containing `<clipPath id="lao-fractal-clip">`
- 75+ lines of complex SVG path data
- Comment: "SVG Definitions for Fractal ClipPath on Logo"

**Result:** Cleaner HTML structure, reduced file size by ~90 lines.

### 3. Removed Unused SVG Assets

**Deleted Files:**
1. `overlay-glow-center.svg` - Not referenced anywhere in the codebase
2. `overlay-vignette-edge.svg` - Not referenced anywhere in the codebase
3. `fractal-accent-corner.svg` - Not referenced anywhere in the codebase
4. `assets/hero/lao-shifu/lao-fractal-mask.svg` - Not referenced anywhere in the codebase

**Result:** Cleaner repository, reduced asset size.

## Elements Preserved (As Required)

✅ **Top Navigation Button Visuals:**
- `.nav-fractal-artifact` - Center fractal artifact in nav grid
- `.nav-artifact-icon` - All 6 artifact icons for nav buttons
- All nav button styling and positioning intact

✅ **Circular Frame Around Logo:**
- `.laoshi-frame` - Decorative outline using `lao-fractal-frame.svg`
- `.laoshi-halo` - Subtle halo layer behind logo
- All frame styling and animations preserved

✅ **Section Frames/Borders:**
- `.fractal-corner` elements in all 6 sections (tl, tr, bl, br corners)
- Animated SVG fractals at section corners
- All section border ornaments intact

✅ **Global Ornaments:**
- `.corner-ornaments` - Corner SVG ornaments (4 files)
- `.border-ornaments` - Top/bottom gradient accents
- Fixed background layer

## Verification

### No Broken References
- All SVG references validated - no missing files
- All CSS classes properly maintained
- No console errors

### No Stray Artifacts Found
- No floating/scrolling artifact "bubbles" between sections
- No stray overlay layers outside sections
- All fractal elements are either:
  - Nav button artifacts (kept)
  - Section frame corners (kept)
  - Logo circular frame (kept)

### Visual Integrity
- Logo renders cleanly with circular shape
- Decorative frame around logo preserved
- Section frames fully functional with animated corners
- Top nav grid layout unchanged
- No layout shifts or visual regressions

## Impact Summary

**Lines Removed:** ~90 lines from `index.html`
**Files Deleted:** 4 unused SVG asset files
**Functionality:** No impact - all required elements preserved
**Performance:** Slightly improved (smaller HTML, fewer assets)
**Security:** No vulnerabilities introduced or detected

## Before/After Visual Comparison

**Before:**
- Logo had fractal cutouts applied via clipPath
- Logo image itself was masked/clipped

**After:**
- Logo renders cleanly as circular image
- Decorative frame around logo preserved
- Logo displays without cutouts or masking on the image itself

See screenshots in PR for visual confirmation.

## Testing Performed

1. ✅ Visual inspection - all sections render correctly
2. ✅ Asset reference validation - no broken links
3. ✅ Navigation functionality - all nav buttons work
4. ✅ Section frames - all corner ornaments display correctly
5. ✅ Logo display - renders cleanly in circular frame
6. ✅ Security scan - no vulnerabilities detected

## Acceptance Criteria Met

- ✅ No stray artifact/bubble elements remain between sections
- ✅ Lao Shifu logo image displays without any cutouts/masking
- ✅ The circular frame around logo remains
- ✅ Top menu button visuals unchanged
- ✅ Section frames/borders fully preserved
- ✅ No broken asset references
- ✅ Repo builds and loads cleanly
- ✅ Cleanup summary included
